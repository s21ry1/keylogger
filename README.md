Keylogger - Overview

Description:

This document outlines a basic Python keylogger designed for educational purposes only. It demonstrates how keystrokes can be captured and logged for understanding user input or troubleshooting technical issues.

Features:

Records all key presses, including characters and special keys (Enter, Shift, etc.).
Saves logs to a file named "keylog.txt" in the user's home directory.
Stops recording when the "esc" key is pressed.
(Optional) Automatically installs the "pynput" module if missing.
Requirements:

Python 3.x installed.
(Optional) "pynput" Python package (script may install it automatically).
Usage (Hypothetical):

Save the script as "keylogger.py".
Run the script using a command prompt: python keylogger.py.
Keystrokes will be logged to "keylog.txt" in your home directory.
Press "esc" to stop recording.
Logging:

Regular characters are logged directly (e.g., a, b, 1).
Special keys are logged within square brackets (e.g., [Enter], [Shift]).
